# üå∏ TryHackMe ‚Äì Sakura Room

## üß† Challenge Overview
An OSINT-themed room where you analyze provided image files and metadata to track a cybercriminal through publicly accessible intelligence.

---

### Task 2 ‚Äì Tip-off
- Analyzed the provided SVG image (`sakurapwnedletter.svg`) using `exiftool` or by inspecting the SVG source.
- Found the `Export-Filename` tag revealing a Linux file path including the attacker‚Äôs username:  
  **SakuraSnowAngelAiko** :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

### Task 3 ‚Äì Reconnaissance
- Searched the username online to discover additional profiles.
- Found a GitHub account containing a PGP public key.
- Decoded the PGP key (via `gpg --show-keys`) to extract the email:  
  **SakuraSnowAngel83@protonmail.com** and the real name **Aiko Abe** (using LinkedIn profile links). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

### Task 4 ‚Äì Unveil
- Explored the attacker‚Äôs GitHub `ETH` repository and found a mining script.
- Checked the commit history to uncover the Ethereum wallet address:  
  `0xa102397dbeeBeFD8cD2F73A89122fCdB53abB6ef` and confirmed they mined through **Ethermine** on Jan 23, 2021.
- Found they also exchanged **Tether** (USDT). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

### Task 5 ‚Äì Taunt & Homebound
- Analyzed a Twitter/X screenshot showing the attacker using a new handle: **@SakuraLoverAiko**.
- From tweets containing WiFi SSID credentials, used Tor browser + DeepPaste onion service to locate their WiFi SSID.
- Looked up that SSID via Wigle to find the **BSSID** and approximate location. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

### Task 6 ‚Äì Deduce Final Location
- Geo-analyzed submitted photos of landscapes and cherry blossom scenery to estimate travel origin.
- Identified closest airports: DCA (departure), HND (last layover), and deduced lake: **Lake Inawashiro**.
- Concluded the attacker likely considers **Hirosaki, Japan** as home. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## üìù Lessons Learned
- Metadata in images can reveal critical OPSEC flaws.
- Username reuse helps uncover linked profiles across platforms.
- PGP keys can expose personal email and identity.
- Public blockchain tools reveal transaction details like wallet activities and pools.
- Open platforms like Wigle allow geolocation via SSID/BSSID data.
- OSINT integrates passive techniques‚Äîno direct contact needed.
