# 🍃 TryHackMe – Neighbour Room

## 🧠 Challenge Description
An easy beginner web challenge demonstrating IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference). It’s a basic login service where the goal is to access your neighbor’s profile page.

## 🔍 Approach
- 🚪 Visited the machine URL via AttackBox.
- Pressed `Ctrl+U` (view page source) to find hidden guest credentials in HTML comments.  
  Guest account: `guest:guest` :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- Logged in as guest, then observed the URL: `profile.php?user=guest`.

## 💡 Exploiting the IDOR
- Changed the URL parameter from `user=guest` to `user=admin`.
- The web app responded by showing the admin dashboard/flag page. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🚩 Outcome
✅ Accessed the neighbor’s/admin profile page and retrieved the flag.

## 📝 Lessons Learned
- HTML comments can expose hidden credentials.
- Unvalidated URL parameters can lead to IDOR vulnerabilities.
- Always validate or sanitize input—even seemingly harmless ones.
